# Problem of the Day (POTD)  

Welcome to the **Problem of the Day (POTD)** repository! This repository is dedicated to daily coding challenges provided by seniors from the **Application Club** to help sharpen our **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** skills.    

## Objective  

This repository is created to strengthen **problem-solving skills** and lay a solid foundation for **technical interviews and competitive programming**. I will be updating it daily with my solutions to the assigned problems, ensuring a consistent record of my progress.  

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** This repository is **not intended for public use**; it serves as a personal tracker for my seniors to monitor my consistency and growth.  

## Repository Structure  

The problems are stored in a structured format under the `POTD_AC/` directory:  

- Each problem is organized by date:  
  - `DD-MM-YYYY/` (e.g., `23-12-2024/`)  
    - `<problem-id>.cpp`: Solution file for that day's problem.  
    - `problem link is provided in the file`

## Special Thanks  

A huge shoutout to the **Application Club seniors** for providing these challenges and guiding us in our **DSA journey**!  

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
